# Hi, I'm Omar Saldaña! 👋

**Data Analyst | Business Automation Specialist**

### 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools:
- **Languages:** Python (Automation & Data Analysis), VBA (Advanced Excel Macros), SQL (MySQL), DAX & M (Power BI).
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,vscode,mysql)](https://skillicons.dev) 
- **Tools:** SAP (S/4HANA), Salesforce, Power BI, Git/GitHub.
- **Expertise:** Budget Control (CAPEX/OPEX), KPI Monitoring, Process Optimization (E2E), and Team Leadership.

### 🚀 What I'm working on:
- 📈 Refining my data analysis skills with Python libraries.
- 🤖 Automating business reporting workflows to reduce execution time (previously achieved a 60% reduction in budget tasks).
- 🐍 Building a portfolio of real-world SQL and Python projects.
